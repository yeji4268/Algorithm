We define an employee's  _total earnings_  to be their monthly  salary * months worked, and the  _maximum total earnings_  to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the  **Employee**  table. Write a query to find the  _maximum total earnings_  for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary.
