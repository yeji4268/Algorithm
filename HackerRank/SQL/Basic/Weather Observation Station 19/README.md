# Title
Weather Observation Station 19

# Problem
Consider $$P_1(a, b)$$ and $$P_2(c, d)$$ to be two points on a 2D plane where (a, b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude(LAT_N) and (c, d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude LONG_W) in STATION.
Query the Euclidean DIsance between points P_1 and P_2 and format your anser to display 4 decimal digits. 

**Input Format**
The **STATION** table is described as follows:
|Field|Type|
|---|---|
|ID|NUMBER|
|CITY|VARCHAR2(21)|
|STATE|VARCHAR2(2)|
|LAT_N|NUMBER|
|LONG_W|NUMBER|

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
